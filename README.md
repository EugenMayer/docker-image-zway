This image should run the latest image of [z-way](https://github.com/Z-Wave-Me/home-automation) for an ARM based build for e.g. an raspberry pi.
A more brief descriptions can probably be found [here](https://www.z-wave.me/index.php?id=22).

Z-way should be compatible with all zwave controllers, be it USB-based or GPIO based, it is not limitted to razberry`s.
It might be, that non z-wave.me based controllers will need a license, see the section 3 on the page, very much below.


See [this howto](https://github.com/EugenMayer/home-assistant-raspberry-zwave/wiki/1.1-Raspbian-OS-with-Docker) on how to get a raspberry pi ready for docker.

We base on the official raspbian [docker image](resin/rpi-raspbian:jessie).
